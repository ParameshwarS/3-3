1. Components of Hadoop 2.x :

Hadoop2 Architecture has mainly 2 set of daemons

 HDFS 2.x Daemons:  Name Node, Secondary Name Node (not required in HA) and Data Nodes
 MapReduce 2.x Daemons (YARN):  Resource Manager, Node Manager


HDFS Daemons:

Name node:

Namenode acts as the master for the Datanode.
It has the directory tree of all files in the system(It has the metadata).
In hadoop 2.x,two namenodes are present and are configured as active and standby nodes.
In case of failure in the active namenode,standby namenode acts as the active namenode.

Datanode:

It stores the actual data.
It acts as ths slave.
In case of any failures,it doesnot afect the stability of the system.
Data will be stored,based on the availability of space in the datanodes.  


MAPREDUCE Daemons:

Resource Manager :


    This daemon process runs on  namenode.
    It gets the job submitted from client and schedules it on cluster.
    It monitors running jobs on cluster and allocates proper resources on the datanode.
    It communicates with Node Manager(in the datanode) to track the resource utilization.
    It uses two other processes:
        Application Manager
        Scheduler(for MapReduce task and resource management)

Node Manager
 

    This daemon process runs on slave nodes (Data node)
    It coordinates with Resource Manager for task scheduling.
    It tracks the resource utilization on the slave node
    It also reports the resource utilization back to the Resource Manager
    It uses
        Application Master
        Container(for MapReduce task scheduling and task execution).
